# Marketo Leads

Allows WordPress forms to create leads within Marketo

Fields starting with `_wp` will be ignored

You can add a comment to a form field name (perhaps to remind you which form it's from) by adding a forward slash and your comment after the name. Note that spaces around the slash will be ignored. Example: `field_name / Contact form`
