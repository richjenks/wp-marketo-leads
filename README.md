# Marketo Leads

Allows WordPress forms to create leads within Marketo.

WP Marketo Leads links a Marketo field with any number of form fields so when that field is submitted it is sent to Marketo as a lead.

## Notes

- Fields starting with `_wp` will be ignored
- You can add a comment to a form field name (perhaps to remind you which form it's from) by adding a forward slash and your comment after the name. Note that spaces around the slash will be ignored. Example: `field_name / Contact form`
